Hi!

Welcome to the world of Maryo!
You are Maryo. Your aim is to dodge the fireballs emitted by the Dragon robot as much as you can by moving yourselves UP and DOWN. Avoid hitting the roof with the
venomous cactus and the fired up floor. In this way beat your own high score every time. The game has 4 levels and each level becomes more difficult as the roof and the
floor come closer to you. TEASE THE DRAGON!!!!

Directions -
* Hold and press UP arrow key to move up.
* Hold and press DOWN arrow key to move down.
* Press ESC to exit the game.

Good luck!

Note:- Do not delete any file from the folder. Run the (.py) file to play the game.
